# Gun-Detection
The Gun Detection Project is a real-time firearm detection system developed using Python and OpenCV. This project leverages Haar cascade classifiers to detect firearms in a live webcam feed and highlights them with bounding boxes. It's a proof-of-concept application that demonstrates the potential of computer vision for enhancing security .
